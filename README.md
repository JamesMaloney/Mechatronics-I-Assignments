# Mechatronics-I-Assignments
A repo containing all the assignments for the "Mechatronics I" course at Reykjav√≠k University, Academic Year 2020/2021 (brief course description below).

This course is an introduction to Mechatronics, the technique of interfacing software, electronics, and mechanical components. The course textbook is "Exploring Raspberry Pi" by Derek Molloy. It is required for the course and critical to completing the Labs assignments.

It begins with an introduction to embedded Linux on the Raspberry Pi SBC and software engineering. This includes Rust, and Git/Subversion (for collaboration). It then shifts to electronics design, implementation, and testing. It covers both analog and digital electronics with a focus on interfacing to sensors, DC motors, and stepper motors.

Students choose a mechatronics group project to be presented at the end of the semester. This project should interface physical elements with the microcontrollers to demonstrate their mastery of the subject.

Each student should go through safety training in the labs as a prerequisite.
